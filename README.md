I developed a full-stack food delivery application using **ReactJS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, providing a seamless and efficient platform for ordering food online. The front-end, built with **ReactJS**, delivers a smooth user experience with a responsive and intuitive UI/UX. The back-end, powered by **Node.js and Express**, ensures robust API handling and efficient order management.  

To enhance user experience, I implemented **shopping cart management** and **secure user authentication**, allowing customers to browse, add items to their cart, and place orders effortlessly. Payments are securely processed through **Stripe**, ensuring a reliable and encrypted transaction system.  

Additionally, I developed an **admin panel** that allows restaurant owners or administrators to **track orders, update statuses, and manage inventory** efficiently. The database is handled using **MongoDB**, enabling fast and scalable data storage for user details, orders, and products.  

This project demonstrates strong proficiency in **full-stack development**, secure payment gateway integration, and responsive web design. With a focus on **scalability and user experience**, the food delivery app provides a streamlined and intuitive platform for both customers and administrators, ensuring a hassle-free online ordering experience.
